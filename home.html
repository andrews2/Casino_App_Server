                Welcome to Wolfpack casino. This app was made as a part of of a senior design project by 
                ECE students at North Carolina State University. The mobile application can be used to scan 
                in casino chips, which were also part of the project, and store them in a digital wallet. This 
                allows users to secure thier chips and better keep track of which chips are theirs. Using NFC technology
                chips can be added to any users digital wallet with the simple tap of their phone. RFID is used as well to 
                allow the casino to constantly locate chips. Please download our Android app below, sign up for an account and
                test out our senior design project.
